<p1>Natural Beauty: Mountains are Picturesque Islands of the Sky

The people of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim call
their respective regions Dev Bhoomi, which indicates their sacred 
attitude towards the Himalayas. cultivate respect for the mountainous
environment, it is important to have a sense of natural purity and 
spiritual practice. Mountain Day was celebrated on December 11 this
year amid unprecedented tragedy in the mountainous regions of the
world, from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Himalayan region
of Uttarakhand</p>

 <h3>Beauty of nature</h3>
 <p3>Mountainous terrains have certain unifying characteristics. Such terrains have higher elevations than do surrounding areas. Moreover, high relief exists within mountain belts and ranges. Individual mountains, mountain ranges, and mountain belts that have been created by different tectonic processes, however, are often characterized by different features.

Chains of active volcanoes, such as those occurring at island arcs, are commonly marked by individual high mountains separated by large expanses of low and gentle topography. In some chains, namely those associated with “hot spots” (see below), only the volcanoes at one end of the chain are active. Thus, those volcanoes stand high, but with increasing distance away from them erosion has reduced the sizes of volcanic structures to an increasing degree</p>

<h4>Mathematical characteristics of mountains</h4>
<p4>It should be noted that the crust and lithosphere are defined by different properties and do not constitute the same layer. Moreover, variations in their thicknesses have different relationships to the overlying topography. Some mountain ranges and plateaus are buoyed up by a thick crust. The lithosphere beneath such areas, however, can be thin, and its strength does not play a significant role in supporting the range or plateau. Other ranges may overlie thick lithospheric plates, which are flexed down by the weight of the mountains. The crust beneath such ranges is likely to be thicker than normal but not as thick as it would be if the lithosphere were thin. Thus, the strength of the lithosphere supports these mountains and maintains the base of the crust at a higher level than would have been the case had the strong layer been absent. For instance, the Himalayas have been thrust onto the crust of the Indian shield, which is underlain by particularly cold, thick lithosphere that has been flexed down by the weight of the high range. The thickness of the crust is about 55 kilometres beneath the high peaks, which stand more than 8,000 metres high. The thickest crustal segment of 70 kilometres, however, lies farther north beneath the Plateau of Tibet (or Tibetan Plateau), whose altitude is about 4,500 to 5,000 metres but whose lithosphere is much thinner than that beneath the Himalayas. The strong Indian lithosphere helps to support the Himalayas, but the buoyancy of the thick Tibetan crust maintains the high elevation of the plateau</p4>

<h5>Tectonic proces </h5>
<p5>As noted above, individual mountains, mountain ranges, mountain belts, and plateaus exist because tectonic processes have elevated terrains faster than erosion could destroy them. High elevations are created by three major processes: these are volcanism, horizontal crustal shortening as manifested by folding and by faulting, and the heating and thermal expansion of large terrains</p5>
